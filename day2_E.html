<!-- Section: FOD Check -->
<section>
    <h2>üõ´ FOD Check</h2>
    <p>
        Foreign Object Debris (FOD) includes any item that doesn‚Äôt belong on the ramp‚Äîsuch as bolts, tools, plastic, or even paper wrappers. These items, though small, can cause major damage if ingested by aircraft engines. FOD checks must be conducted three times. <ul>Pre-arrival</ul><ul> Pre-departure</ul> <ul> Post-departure</ul> Everyone working at the bay is responsible for maintaining a clean and safe ramp. Items found should be disposed of in designated FOD bins located in each bay or on the passenger ramp.

<!-- Section: Jet Ingest vs Jet Blast -->
<section>
    <h2>üö´ Jet Ingest vs Jet Blast</h2>
    <p>
        Jet engines pose two main hazards: jet ingest and jet blast. Jet ingest occurs at the front of the engine, where strong suction can pull in nearby objects‚Äîor people. Jet blast happens at the rear and can send powerful gusts of air that knock over objects or workers. To stay safe, keep at least 5.79 meters from the front and 60 meters from the rear of any active engine. Always stay outside the Engine Running Area (ERA) when engines are on.

<!-- Section: Safe Time to Approach the Aircraft -->
<section>
    <h2>‚úàÔ∏è Safe Time to Approach the Aircraft</h2>
    <p>
        Approach the aircraft only after the engines have completely shut down, the Aircraft Communication Beacon (ACB) is turned off, chocks are in place, and the engineer has given the "all clear" signal. On Airbus aircraft, ACBs are located on the top and bottom of the fuselage; on ATR aircraft, they are on top of the tail and bottom of the fuselage. Always visually confirm these safety cues before moving close to the aircraft.

<!-- Section: Cone and Chocks Placement -->
<section>
    <h2>üîß Cone and Chocks Placement: A320, A321, ATR</h2>
    <p>
        Proper cone and chock placement ensures the aircraft remains secure. For the A320 and A321, use 11 cones and 8 chocks during normal weather; increase to 12 chocks during high winds. For ATR aircraft, use 10 cones and 6 chocks regardless of wind conditions. In winds above 25 knots, remove all cones to prevent them from becoming dangerous projectiles. Always refer to the placement guidelines for each aircraft type.

<!-- Section: 3 Door Operation -->
<section>
    <h2>ü¶Ö 3 Door Operation</h2>
    <p>
        Different aircraft models require different door configurations during operations. The Airbus A320 uses L1, L2, and R1 for boarding and servicing. The longer Airbus A321 uses L1, L4, and R1 to enable faster turnaround and passenger flow. Understanding the door layout helps in proper equipment placement and safe ramp operations.
    </p>

</section>

<!-- Section: Hotel Mode in ATR -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Hotel Mode in ATR</h2>
    <p>
        Hotel Mode refers to the ATR aircraft using its APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) to power onboard systems while the main engines are off. Unlike when connected to a Ground Power Unit (GPU), Hotel Mode means the aircraft is self-powered. This mode supports lighting, air conditioning, and avionics but requires caution. The APU exhaust is hot, and systems remain active. Always wear PPE and maintain safe distance during Hotel Mode operations.
    </p>

<!-- Section: Load Distribution Message (LDM) -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Load Distribution Message (LDM)</h2>
    <p>
        The Load Distribution Message (LDM) provides detailed information about the distribution of passengers, baggage, and cargo. Proper balance is critical to avoid dangerous shifts in the aircraft‚Äôs center of gravity. Overloading either end of the aircraft can result in instability during flight. Always refer to the LDM to ensure even and safe loading.
    </p>
    <img src="img/awareness.jpeg" alt="LDM Awareness">
</section>

<!-- Section: Load Instruction Report (LIR) -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Load Instruction Report (LIR)</h2>
    <p>
        The Load Instruction Report (LIR) outlines how and where cargo, mail, and baggage should be loaded. It includes three columns: Arrival Load (items already onboard), Planned Loading (intended load), and Final Loading (actual load after check-in). Accurate adherence to the LIR is essential to maintain balance and ensure a safe flight. No changes should be made without proper approval.
    </p>
    <img src="img/awareness.jpeg" alt="LIR Instructions">
</section>

<!-- Section: HUM ‚Äì Handling Human Remains -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Handling HUM (Human Remains)</h2>
    <p>
        Handling HUM cargo requires respect, care, and strict adherence to procedures. On Airbus aircraft, HUM is placed in the bulk hold (5th compartment), with the head facing the nose of the aircraft to prevent internal fluid movement during flight. Always secure with two straps and follow package labels such as "This Side Up." Improper handling is both disrespectful and unsafe.
    </p>
    <img src="img/awareness.jpeg" alt="HUM Handling">
</section>

<!-- Section 26: Wind Chart -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Wind Chart Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
        The wind chart is a critical operational reference that outlines mandatory safety precautions based on wind speed. The stronger the wind, the greater the risk to ground operations and personnel safety. Adhering to wind chart thresholds ensures aircraft and equipment are protected from damage and prevents injury on the ramp.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>25‚Äì39 knots:</strong> Secure all loose items and monitor wind-sensitive equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>40‚Äì59 knots:</strong> Tie down ground equipment, chock aircraft wheels, and suspend non-essential operations.</li>
        <li><strong>60+ knots:</strong> Cease all ramp operations, evacuate exposed areas, and shelter all ground personnel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The wind chart should be treated as an enforceable operational policy. Ground personnel must never continue working in violation of wind limits. Safety takes precedence over schedule.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 27: SMS ‚Äì Safety Management System -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Safety Management System (SMS)</h2>
    <p>
        A Safety Management System (SMS) provides a structured framework for identifying, reporting, and mitigating hazards on the ramp. Every staff member is responsible for safety awareness and timely reporting.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Definitions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hazard:</strong> Any condition or object with the potential to cause injury, damage, or operational disruption (e.g., oil spills, equipment defects, or foreign objects).</li>
        <li><strong>Incident:</strong> An unplanned event that does not result in damage or injury but indicates a safety risk (e.g., near misses).</li>
        <li><strong>Accident:</strong> An event resulting in injury, damage, or loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reporting Protocol:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Report hazards such as equipment malfunctions or unsafe parking under aerobridges to the Safety and GSE teams immediately.</li>
        <li>Use the physical SMS form available in the backup office or the digital reporting tool via 6E Breez.</li>
        <li>Never attempt to fix or hide safety issues independently‚Äîalways report first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Prompt reporting prevents minor hazards from escalating into serious incidents. SMS participation is mandatory for all operational staff.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 28: Disability Awareness -->
<section>
    <h2>üí° Disability Awareness on the Ramp</h2>
    <p>
        Disability encompasses a wide range of visible and invisible conditions that may affect an individual‚Äôs ability to perform tasks or interact in typical ways. Ground crew and ramp staff must demonstrate respect, patience, and inclusivity when working with passengers or colleagues with disabilities.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Types of Disabilities Include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual Impairment</li>
        <li>Hearing Impairment</li>
        <li>Mobility Impairment</li>
        <li>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</li>
        <li>Down Syndrome</li>
        <li>Cerebral Palsy</li>
        <li>Epilepsy</li>
        <li>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</li>
        <li>Parkinson‚Äôs Disease</li>
        <li>Amputation</li>
        <li>Spinal Cord Injury</li>
        <li>Schizophrenia</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
